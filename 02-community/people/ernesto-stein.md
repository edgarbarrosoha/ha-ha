## Relationship with HA
- **Active co-author** — paper in progress, Edgar handles AI codification, Ernesto brings policy/econ legitimacy
- Colleague at Tec de Monterrey, School of Government
- Attended Edgar's research seminar (Feb 13, 2026), stayed to congratulate. Key feedback: "sé que eres un genio y que las cosas las haces bien, pero es muy abstracto para mí"
- Translation: he intuits value but needs concrete cases grounded in policy literature he reads
- Strategic value: co-authorship with ex-BID chief economist = Edgar's methodology enters the policy canon
- If Ernesto can cite Edgar's work in his own papers, legitimacy gap narrows significantly
