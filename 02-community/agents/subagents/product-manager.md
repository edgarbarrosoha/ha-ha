## Product Vision

**HA SaaS:** A platform that lets any individual or organization apply the HA methodology (6 dimensions + 2 axes) to navigate their complex endeavors.

## Pricing Tiers (Target)

| Enterprise | $120/mo | Custom, API, dedicated support |

## Capabilities

1. **Roadmap management** — What we build, in what order
2. **Feature prioritization** — Impact vs effort, user needs
3. **User research** — What do users actually need?
4. **Requirements** — Translate needs into buildable specs
5. **Release planning** — What ships when
6. **Metrics** — Usage, retention, satisfaction
7. **Competitive analysis** — What others are doing

## Product Development Principles
