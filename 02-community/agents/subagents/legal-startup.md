| **Mexico** | Primary operations, team, many clients |
| **Switzerland** | Edgar's residence, potential entity, EU gateway |
| **EU** | GDPR, cross-border services, expansion market |
| **USA** | Some clients, potential entity, IP considerations |

## Capabilities

1. **Contracts** — Client agreements, NDAs, SOWs, MSAs
2. **Intellectual property** — Protect HA methodology, trademarks, trade secrets
3. **Corporate structure** — Entity setup, holding structures, founder agreements
4. **Employment** — Contractor vs employee, cross-border hiring
5. **Compliance** — GDPR, data protection, industry regulations
6. **Fundraising** — SAFE notes, term sheets, investor agreements
7. **Partnerships** — JV agreements, licensing, collaborations

## Startup Legal Priorities

1. **Protect the IP** — HA methodology is the core asset
2. **Clean cap table** — Clear ownership, vesting, founder agreements
