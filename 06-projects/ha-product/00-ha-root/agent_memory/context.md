# HA-Product Session Memory

## ZONE A: Identity (Immutable)

### Project Scope
- **Level:** 2 (Project)
- **Scope:** Consumer AI product — HA personal assistant
- **Role:** Product architect + founder
- **Parent:** HA-HA (Domain)
- **Grandparent:** HA-EB (Root)

### Product Identity
- **Pitch:** "ChatGPT da respuestas. HA da perspectiva."
- **Architecture:** 7 universal agents (Root + 6 dimensions)
- **MVP:** 8-week roadmap, Next.js + Supabase + Claude
- **Pricing:** Free → Pro ($19) → Coach ($49) → Team ($15/user)
- **North Star:** WAU who report HA understands them (>4.0/5)

### Permanent Resources
- **Product spec:** `00-ha-root/product-spec.md`
- **5-minute experience:** `01-legacy/5-minute-ha-experience.md`
- **Tech architecture:** `04-technology/technical-architecture.md`
- **Agent definitions:** `04-technology/universal-agents.md`
- **MVP roadmap:** `06-projects/mvp-roadmap.md`
- **Product suite vision:** `04-technology/product-suite-vision.md`

## ZONE B: Wisdom (Evolving)

### Decisions
- [2025] DEC: Framework must be invisible to users | WHY: Users want to feel understood, not learn a methodology. HA is the engine, not the interface | STATUS: active
- [2025] DEC: 5-minute clarity experience as onboarding | WHY: Users must discover value in first session or they churn. 5 disguised questions prove HA is different | STATUS: active
- [2025] DEC: Claude as primary LLM | WHY: Best reasoning, most reliable for nuanced dimensional thinking | STATUS: active
- [2025] DEC: Coach tier ($49) as growth engine | WHY: Each coach brings N clients. Viral without marketing spend | STATUS: active
- [2025] DEC: Supabase over custom backend | WHY: Auth + DB + realtime in one. Minimizes MVP complexity | STATUS: active

### Patterns
- PAT:invisible-framework | Users never see "6 dimensions" — they experience understanding, organization, perspective | REF: product-spec.md
- PAT:persistent-context | Every conversation enriches the user profile. Value grows with time | REF: technical-architecture.md
- PAT:coach-viral | Coaches adopt → use with clients → clients adopt → refer → organic growth | REF: product-spec.md
- PAT:dimensional-routing | Root agent analyzes intent → routes to relevant dimension agents → synthesizes → responds | REF: universal-agents.md

### Key Intelligence
- HA-EB (30+ sessions) proves the concept works for power users
- The gap: nobody has replicated this for regular users
- Competitive moat: HA framework + persistent dimensional memory
- Risk: OpenAI/Anthropic launch similar (mitigate via framework depth + community)
- 79% gross margin on Pro tier — healthy SaaS economics

## ZONE C: State (Dynamic)

### Last Session
- **Date:** 2026-02-15
- **Type:** HA instancing
- **Achievements:** Full agent memory created. Product vision preserved.

### Active Threads
- [!] Team formation (BLOCKER — need developer(s))
- [ ] Budget confirmation for development
- [ ] Repo setup + tech stack finalization
- [ ] Sprint 1: Auth + chat with memory

### Waiting For
- [<] Developer(s) — team formation is the bottleneck
- [?] Budget — development cost needs confirmation

### Critical Dates
- **TBD** → Team formed
- **TBD** → MVP start (8 weeks from team formation)
- **TBD** → Beta launch (50 users)

### Next Session Priorities
1. Define team formation strategy (hire? contract? Oscar?)
2. Confirm budget for 8-week MVP
3. Set up repo and development environment

### Recent Sessions

| Date | Session | Focus | Key Achievement |
|------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| 2026-02-15 | 1 | HA instancing | Agent memory created, full context preserved |
