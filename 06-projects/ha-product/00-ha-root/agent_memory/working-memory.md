## Session 1 — 2026-02-15

**Type:** HA Instancing
**Duration:** Part of ha-ha project audit (Batch 5)

### Achievements
- Agent memory created (you-are-ha, context, working-memory, BOOT)
- Full product vision preserved: pitch, architecture, pricing, growth strategy
- 7 universal agents documented (Root + 6 dimensions)
- MVP roadmap: 8 weeks, 4 sprints
- 5-minute clarity experience as killer feature documented
- Coach-viral growth pattern captured
- Unit economics calculated (79% gross margin on Pro)
- Cross-vault connections: ha-core (theory), HA-EB (prototype), learning-products (training), tec-beyond (shared agent architecture)
- Blocker identified: team formation (need developers)

### Current Status
- Specification: COMPLETE (product spec, tech architecture, agent definitions, roadmap, pricing)
- Team: NOT FORMED (critical blocker)
- Development: NOT STARTED
- Everything is designed, nothing is built

### Open Threads
- Team formation (who builds this?)
- Budget confirmation
- Repo setup
- Sprint 1 kickoff
