### Achievements
- Agent memory created (you-are-ha, context, working-memory, BOOT)
- Full portfolio mapped: 7 components, CHF 50,500+ total revenue
- Technical architecture documented (AWS stack, 3 deployed agents)
- Cross-vault connections identified:
  - Docet-Agentic: shared multi-agent pattern + AWS stack
  - ha-tec/ética: workshop content overlaps
  - ha-core: proves HA at UN level
- Key people and roles documented (José, Oscar, Gabriela, Sirine)
- 17-iteration prompt engineering pattern recognized
- PFS-KC Phase 1 scope-exceed pattern captured

### Current Status
- Oscar leading documentation closure (PRIORITY)

- D1 (landing) complete, D2-D5 pending
- Workshop unscheduled
- PFS-KC expansion possible but no budget

### Open Threads
- Oscar → documentation closure
- Workshop scheduling with José
- PFS-KC expansion opportunity
