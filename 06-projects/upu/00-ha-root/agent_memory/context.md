## ZONE B: Wisdom (Evolving)

### Decisions
- [2024-10] DEC: Accept UPU engagement as HA's first UN-level client | WHY: Validates international consulting model, opens institutional market | STATUS: active
- [2025-01] DEC: Subcontract Antena Labs for frontend/UX (CHF 11,500) | WHY: Gabriela's team handles design; HA focuses on architecture + AI | STATUS: active
- [2025-07] DEC: Tiered invoicing — EB (strategic advisory) + HA (technical implementation) | WHY: Separates consulting from development revenue streams | STATUS: active
- [2025-11] DEC: PFS-KC Phase 1 at CHF 10,000, deliberately exceed scope | WHY: Demonstrate capability for Phases 2-4 expansion | STATUS: delivered
- [2026-02] DEC: Oscar leads documentation closure with 2 new devs | WHY: Clean handover, project must terminate cleanly | STATUS: active

### Patterns
- PAT:prompt-iteration | Voice agent prompt evolved through 17 versions → each iteration improves accuracy, persona, error handling | REF: voice-agent-prompts/
- PAT:scope-exceed | Deliver significantly more than contracted → builds trust for expansion | REF: PFS-KC Phase 1
- PAT:tiered-consulting | EB = strategic (high-touch), HA = implementation (scalable), AL = design (specialized) | REF: invoice structure
- PAT:international-payments | CHF invoicing, UBS (Edgar) + BANORTE (HA), 30-day net terms | REF: 05-context/finance/

### Key People
- **José Anson** — UDP PM, primary client contact, technical decisions go through him
- **Sirine** — 2IPD methodology expert, data updates (v2.1), key for content accuracy
- **Oscar Díaz** — CTO, owns all technical delivery and documentation
- **Gabriela German** — Antena Labs director, frontend/UX execution

### Key Intelligence
- 2IPD = Integrated Index for Postal Development (4 pillars: Reliability, Reach, Relevance, Resilience)
- Voice agent persona: "Patient Expert Guide" — educational, calm, structured, manages cognitive load
- PFS-KC delivered production-ready architecture that exceeded Phase 1 scope → expansion possible
- Workshop (6h) still unscheduled — potential revenue and relationship deepener
