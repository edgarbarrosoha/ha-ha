## ZONE B: Wisdom (Evolving)

### Decisions
- [2025-06] DEC: Simplify 16 behaviors into 5 leadership dimensions (EJECUTA, UNE, IMPULSA, NAVEGA, CREA) | WHY: 16 is too many for meaningful conversation. 5 is actionable and memorable | STATUS: active
- [2025-06] DEC: Conversation-first, not survey-first | WHY: Qualitative depth reveals blind spots that numeric scores miss. This differentiates Tali from every other 360 | STATUS: active
- [2025-06] DEC: 70-20-10 development model | WHY: Proven framework (on-the-job 70%, learning from others 20%, formal training 10%) for sustainable development | STATUS: active
- [2025-08] DEC: Board narrative positions Tali as "Jarvis for Talisis" | WHY: Frames AI investment as institutional intelligence, not just HR tool. Gets board buy-in for broader platform | STATUS: active

### Patterns
- PAT:ha-builder-interview | Use HA's 6+2 dimensions to interview executives → extract organizational DNA systematically | REF: interview prompts v01-v03
- PAT:culture-diagnostic | Interview multiple executives → synthesize across dimensions → identify convergences and tensions | REF: ha-builder-interviews/
- PAT:proposal-narrative | Board presentation = early wins + capabilities + vision + commercial potential + call to action | REF: narrative.md

### Key Intelligence from Interviews
- Alejandro Madrazo (Director Académico): 2-pillar vision (accessible education for low-income + reimagine education foundations). Technology = tool for social needs, not end in itself. Teachers need career paths meeting economic + professional + intellectual needs.
- Organizational assessment: strong purpose, high-performance culture, but fragmented systems, manual processes, data quality issues
- Members want: standardization, automation, AI integration, better onboarding, transversal collaboration
