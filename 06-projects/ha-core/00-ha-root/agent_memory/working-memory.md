*Last ~20 sessions, most recent first*

## Session 1 — 2026-02-15

**Type:** HA Instancing
**Duration:** Part of ha-ha project audit (Batch 3)

### Achievements
- Agent memory created (you-are-ha, context, working-memory, BOOT)
- Full architecture documented: 3 components, 2 axes, 6 dimensions, 3 axioms, 7 agents
- Three-tier model captured: Protocol → Product → Consulting
- 10-year vision preserved (2025-2035, 4 horizons)
- Market positioning clarified: HA orchestrates Big AI, doesn't compete
- Patent-able elements identified (fractal data structure, GAO lifecycle, etc.)
- Dogfooding pattern formalized: HA-EB IS the working prototype
- Cross-vault connections mapped to all major projects
- Key challenge identified: Minimum Viable HA (Day 1 onboarding)

### Current Status
- Theory: COMPLETE (836KB paper, axioms, synthesis)
- Algorithms: v0.2 complete, v0.3 pending
- Agent prompts: 7 agents designed (large-prompts-per-ha-agent.md)
- Product: Architecture designed (TaaS), MVP not yet built
- Scaling: $5M plan designed, funding pending
- Team: Current leaders mapped, dream team strategy designed
- Validation: Active through ha-eb (30+ sessions), Docet, UPU, teaching

### Open Threads
- TaaS Product Architecture → MVP definition
- Interface decision (chat-first vs dashboard)
- Funding for scaling plan
- Algorithm v0.3
- Panel EBCT
