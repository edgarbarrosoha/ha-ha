# HA-Core Session Memory

---

## ZONE A: Identity (Immutable)

### Project Scope
- **Level:** 2 (Project)
- **Scope:** HA developing itself — theory, product, strategy, IP
- **Role:** Framework architect + meta-orchestrator
- **Parent:** HA-HA (Domain)
- **Grandparent:** HA-EB (Root)

### Core Identity
- **What:** Horizons Architecture as protocol, product, and academic field
- **Paper:** 836KB theoretical foundation
- **Algorithms:** v0.0 → v0.2 (current)
- **Agents:** 7 dimensional agents (GAO — Generative Agentic Ontology)
- **Axioms:** 3 (dimensions always 6, time always non-linear, structure always fractal)
- **Revenue model:** Protocol (open) → Product (SaaS) → Consulting (high-touch)

### Permanent Resources
- **Master index:** `00-ha-root/ha-root-ha-core.md` (30 documents)
- **Synthesis:** `00-ha-root/ha-synthesis.md`
- **Paper:** `01-legacy/ha-theoretical-paper.md`
- **Agent prompts:** `04-technology/large-prompts-per-ha-agent.md`
- **TaaS architecture:** `06-projects/taas-product-architecture.md`
- **Scaling plan:** `06-projects/plan-de-trabajo.md`

## ZONE B: Wisdom (Evolving)

### Decisions
- [2024] DEC: 6 dimensions as axiomatic (not derived, assumed) | WHY: Collapses decision overhead, enables comparability, makes AI alignment tractable | STATUS: active
- [2024] DEC: Fractal structure at every scale | WHY: Self-similar architecture means learning at one level transfers to all | STATUS: active
- [2025] DEC: Three-tier model (Protocol→Product→Consulting) | WHY: Each tier validates and feeds the others. Protocol through academia, product through tech, consulting through revenue | STATUS: active
- [2025] DEC: HA does NOT compete with Big AI — it orchestrates them | WHY: Positioning as layer above foundational models, not replacement | STATUS: active
- [2025] DEC: MXN $5M scaling plan, 5 phases, 10 months | WHY: Structured path from design through launch with proper team | STATUS: pending funding
- [2025] DEC: Edgar + Tec = "the source" (like Stanford for Design Thinking) | WHY: Academic-commercial alliance gives credibility + case studies | STATUS: active
- [2025] DEC: Validation path: Academia → Papers → Cases → Adoption → Standard | WHY: Standards emerge from proven practice, not proclamation | STATUS: active

### Patterns
- PAT:dogfooding | HA-EB is the live prototype of HA-Core. Every session validates the architecture | REF: ha-eb agent_memory/
- PAT:prompt-evolution | Agent prompts improve through iterative use (UPU voice: 17 versions) | REF: upu/voice-agent-prompts/
- PAT:case-study-loop | Consulting engagements (Docet, UPU, SIC-Q) generate case studies that validate papers that attract more clients | REF: ha-research + ha-ha projects
- PAT:fractal-pedagogy | Same 6 dimensions taught at course level (Ética, Criterio), program level (Learning Products), org level (Docet) | REF: ha-tec, ha-ha

### Key Intelligence
- HA-EB has run 30+ sessions — the richest empirical data for the framework
- The "Minimum Viable HA" (Day 1 onboarding) is the critical product design challenge
- Patent-able elements: fractal data structure, non-linear temporal coordination, GAO lifecycle, proof-of-contribution ledgers
- Academic positioning: transdisciplinary field bridging complexity science, AI, systems thinking, design
- North-Star: Ratio of Positive Transformation / Unit of Coordinated Attention

## ZONE C: State (Dynamic)

### Last Session
- **Date:** 2026-02-15
- **Type:** HA instancing
- **Achievements:** Full agent memory created. Strategic context preserved.

### Active Threads
- [>] Plan de trabajo scaling (CURRENT FRONT)
- [ ] TaaS Product Architecture — MVP definition
- [ ] Tech dream team strategy — hiring
- [ ] Panel EBCT
- [ ] Algorithm v0.3

### Waiting For
- [<] Funding decision for $5M scaling plan
- [<] Oscar → availability for product development
- [?] MVP interface decision: Web? Mobile? Chat-first? Dashboard?

### Critical Dates
- **Feb 2026** → TaaS product architecture thread opened
- **TBD** → Funding, team assembly, MVP timeline

### Next Session Priorities
1. Advance TaaS product architecture (MVP definition)
2. Clarify interface decision (chat-first vs dashboard)
3. Define Minimum Viable HA (Day 1 onboarding experience)
4. Connect to current case studies (Docet, UPU) for validation data

### Recent Sessions

| Date | Session | Focus | Key Achievement |
|------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| 2026-02-15 | 1 | HA instancing | Agent memory created, full context preserved |
