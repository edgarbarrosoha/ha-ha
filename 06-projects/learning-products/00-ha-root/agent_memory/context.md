# HA-Learning-Products Session Memory

---

## ZONE A: Identity (Immutable)

### Project Scope
- **Level:** 2 (Project)
- **Scope:** Design and produce learning products that teach the HA framework
- **Role:** Content architect + product owner
- **Parent:** HA-HA (Domain)
- **Grandparent:** HA-EB (Root)

### Product Identity
- **Portfolio:** 5 products (course, program, hooks, 3h workshop, 6h workshop)
- **Team Lead:** Betty Huerta
- **Support:** Sarahí Orduño
- **Quality Target:** Level 1 (Foundational) for all 5 by Q1 2026
- **First Deployment:** Leiden University, Mar-Jun 2026

### Permanent Resources
- **Flagship Syllabus:** `06-projects/entrepreneurship-with-ha/course-syllabus.md` (31KB)
- **Dashboard:** `dashboard.md`
- **Context (existing):** `00-ha-root/context.md`
- **Notion ref:** Productos Learning (Notion workspace)

## ZONE B: Wisdom (Evolving)

### Decisions
- [2026-Q1] DEC: 5 products to Level 1 as Q1 target | WHY: Foundational materials (Facilitator Guide, Presentation, Participant Materials, Evaluation Kit) are the minimum for anyone other than Edgar to deliver | STATUS: active
- [2026-Q1] DEC: Entrepreneurship course leads — all other products learn from it | WHY: Most developed (31KB syllabus), first deployment (Leiden), highest complexity. Patterns discovered here cascade to simpler products | STATUS: active
- [2026-Q1] DEC: Canvases ARE the product, not accessories | WHY: System Map, Positionality Map, etc. are what students actually use. Without well-designed canvases, the syllabus is just a plan | STATUS: active
- [2026-Q1] DEC: Facilitator independence test — "Can Betty deliver this alone?" | WHY: If it requires Edgar, it's consulting, not a product. Scalability depends on separation from creator | STATUS: active

### Patterns
- PAT:three-axes | Dimensions (6) × Time (retro/present/prospective) × Scale (self→system) = complete navigation space | REF: course-syllabus.md
- PAT:agentic-layer | Students configure AI agent as their venture's HA instance → agent maintains vault, synthesizes, tracks, challenges | REF: course-syllabus.md
- PAT:canvas-cascade | Design tool for flagship course → adapt to workshops → simplify for hooks | REF: 9 tools in syllabus
- PAT:adaptation-templates | Same course at 12w, 14w, 18w, or 5-day intensive | REF: course-syllabus.md adaptation guides

### Key Innovations (Entrepreneurship Course)
- **5 Phases:** Positionality & Entry → Architecture & Instantiation → Discovery & Validation → Build & Iterate → Integration & Network
- **9 Tools:** System Map, Positionality Map, Theory of Change, Empathy Map, Technology Assessment, Assumption Map, Discovery Interview Guide, Experiment Card, Social Business Model Canvas
- **Assessment:** Individual 40% + Team 50% + Network Contribution 10%

## ZONE C: State (Dynamic)

### Last Session
- **Date:** 2026-02-15
- **Type:** HA instancing
- **Achievements:** Full agent memory created. Product portfolio mapped. Cross-vault connections identified.

### Active Threads
- [>] Canvas design: System Map (CURRENT — Betty + Sarahí)
- [ ] Canvas design: Positionality Map
- [ ] Leiden syllabus adaptation (Mar-Jun 2026)
- [ ] Plan de Vida scope definition
- [ ] Hooks, Taller 3h, Taller 6h design

### Waiting For
- [<] Betty → System Map canvas draft
- [<] Leiden → Local logistics for course adaptation

### Critical Dates
- **Q1 2026** → All 5 products to Level 1
- **Mar 2026** → Leiden course begins (needs adapted syllabus before)

### Next Session Priorities
1. Check canvas design progress (System Map)
2. Review Betty's output
3. Advance Positionality Map design
4. Begin Leiden adaptation checklist

### Recent Sessions

| Date | Session | Focus | Key Achievement |
|------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| 2026-02-15 | 1 | HA instancing | Agent memory created, full context preserved |
