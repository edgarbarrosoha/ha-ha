# Entrepreneurship with Horizons Architecture

## A 14-Week Course for Building Ventures Through Human-AI Partnership

---

## Course Overview

This course applies the Horizons Architecture (HA) framework to entrepreneurship education. Students develop a validated venture concept by working through HA's six dimensions, supported by an AI agent as thinking partner throughout the process.

By Week 14, each team has a venture concept, validated assumptions, and a living HA architecture they can continue developing after the course ends.

### Core Premises

1. **Ventures operate as complex adaptive systems.** The six HA dimensions provide structure for navigating this complexity.

2. **AI partnership accelerates learning.** Students work with an AI agent throughout—for synthesis, memory, analysis, and challenge.

3. **Positionality matters.** Before asking "what problem should I solve?" students examine their relationship to the system they aim to change.

4. **The deliverable is a living system.** Beyond a pitch deck or business plan, students build a HA instance with memory, context, and capacity to evolve.

5. **Alignment requires attention.** The course includes checkpoints where students examine whether their venture should exist, not just whether it can.

## Three Axes of Navigation

Students navigate complexity through three simultaneous axes:

### Axis 1: The Six Dimensions

| Dimension      | Question                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Legacy**     | What endures beyond you?                                |
| **Community**  | Who are you serving and who serves with you?            |
| **Learning**   | How do you adapt and grow?                              |
| **Technology** | What capabilities do you need and what are their costs? |
| **Context**    | What external forces shape possibility?                 |
| **Projects**   | What concrete actions move you forward?                 |

### Axis 2: Time

| Temporal Mode     | Focus                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Retrospective** | What has been tried? What can we learn from failure?         |
| **Present**       | What is the current system state? Where are leverage points? |
| **Prospective**   | What becomes possible? What futures are we creating?         |

### Axis 3: Scale (Fractal)

| Level       | Scope                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Self**    | Personal positionality and capacity      |
| **Team**    | Collective intelligence and coordination |
| **Venture** | The entity being created                 |
| **Network** | Connection to other ventures and systems |
| **System**  | The broader ecosystem being affected     |

---

## The Agentic Layer

Each team works with an AI agent configured as their venture's HA instance. This partnership is central to the course methodology.

### What the Agent Does

- Maintains the venture's HA vault (memory, context, directives)
- Synthesizes research and interview data
- Tracks assumptions and evidence across dimensions
- Generates drafts for iteration
- Challenges blind spots and asks hard questions
- Documents learning and decisions

### What Humans Do

- Make all final decisions
- Conduct stakeholder relationships
- Exercise judgment on ethics and alignment
- Provide the "why" that drives the "what"
- Own the vision and take responsibility

### The Partnership Model

```
Human: Direction, Judgment, Relationships, Accountability
Agent: Synthesis, Memory, Analysis, Drafting, Challenge
Together: Faster iteration, deeper reflection, better outcomes
```

## HA Approach to Entrepreneurship

| Element | HA Approach |

| Starting point | Positionality and personal connection |
| Progression | Non-linear, dimension-aware |
| AI role | Integral partner throughout |
| Primary deliverable | Living HA instance |
| Team structure | Network-embedded |
| Business model | One artifact within larger architecture |
| Validation purpose | Learning, not proving |
| Post-course | Architecture continues |
| Key question | "Should this exist?" alongside "Can this work?" |

## For the Facilitator

This course works best with a facilitator who:

- Understands the HA framework
- Is comfortable with AI-native methods
- Can hold space for difficult conversations (positionality, ethics, pivot decisions)
- Trusts the process when teams struggle
- Values pivots and stops as much as perseverance

The facilitator guides the process and asks hard questions. The students own their ventures.

*This syllabus evolves with each cohort, incorporating learning, adapting to context, and maintaining alignment with the mission of creating ventures that matter.*
