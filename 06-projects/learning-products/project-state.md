## Team

- **Betty Huerta** — Lead (also: learning platform, HA office NL strategy)
- **Sarahí Orduño** — Support + Training leads coordination

## Current Front

- **Deliverable:** Canvases for Entrepreneurship with HA + close training leads
- **Type:** design + sales
- **Context:** Multiple revenue streams emerging. Sarahí + Betty leading training business. Companies calling for deep thinking / decision-making courses. Leiden confirmed. NL course already paid.
- **Key strategic thread:** Betty + Sarahí + Edgar need to discuss HA office opening strategy (NL). Free workshops → academic talks → establish → formalize. This is bigger than individual projects.
