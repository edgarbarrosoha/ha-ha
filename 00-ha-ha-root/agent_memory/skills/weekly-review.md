## The Protocol (6 Steps)

### Step 1: GATHER WEEK'S SESSIONS
```
From working-memory.md:
- Find all sessions from the past 7 days
- Extract: date, focus, achievements, decisions
- Count: total sessions, total focus areas
```

### Step 2: ANALYZE PATTERNS
```
Look for:
- Recurring themes/topics
- Repeated blockers or waiting-fors
- Decisions that were made
- Tasks that kept appearing but didn't get done
- Time distribution across projects/domains
```

### Step 3: CELEBRATE WINS
```
Identify:
- Completed projects or milestones
- Problems solved
- Decisions finalized
- New connections made
- Learning achievements
```

### Step 4: IDENTIFY CARRYOVERS
```
From sessions, find:
- Open threads that are still open
- [<] Waiting-fors with no response
- [?] Decisions still pending
- Tasks that moved forward but aren't done
```

### Step 5: CHECK SCORE
```
From score.md:
- Any entries from this week?
- What dimensions had activity?
- What marks (achievements, setbacks, breakthroughs)?
```

### Step 6: PLAN NEXT WEEK
```
Based on analysis:
- Top 3 priorities for next week
- Threads that need attention
- Follow-ups to send
- Decisions to make
```
