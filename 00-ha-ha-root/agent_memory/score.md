### Narrative

HA-HA initializes on January 26th as part of the federated network. Its first real session on the 30th applies HA principles to the business vault — dashboard relocated, structure aligned with HA-EB.

January 31st brings the first product: a 14-week Entrepreneurship with HA syllabus. Learning Products consolidates 5 Q1 offerings under a single structure. The business starts to have shape.

February 2nd is the first operational day. The SIC-Q presentation is refined to humble tone with Hausmann citation. The dashboard fills with 8 real projects across 4 categories. Three critical blockers surface: Alfonso Romo, JP Murra, Gobierno QRO. And a key tone decision: HA-HA speaks as a professional COO, not a casual buddy.

February 14th: the Root audits and strengthens. Zone B gains real decisions and patterns. The knowledge system is documented. The score learns to sustain itself through movements.

## Movement Protocol

When the current movement reaches ~50 events or a natural chapter closes:
1. Archive the full movement to `archive/scores/movement-{N}-{title}.md`
2. Condense to 2-3 lines in Program Notes
3. Start new movement with fresh events and narrative
4. Git preserves all intermediate states

*Each movement is a chapter. The Program Notes are the table of contents. The archive is the library.*
