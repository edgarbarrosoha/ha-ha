## ZONE B: Wisdom (Evolving)

### Decisions
- [2026-01-30] DEC: Dashboard lives in 06-projects/, not agent_memory | WHY: Action lives in projects dimension, aligned with HA-EB pattern | STATUS: active
- [2026-01-31] DEC: All 5 Q1 learning products organized under single HA project | WHY: Coherent portfolio, shared resources | STATUS: active
- [2026-02-02] DEC: Dashboard structure: 4 categories (Government & Civic Tech, Education & AI, Products & Frameworks, International) | WHY: Maps to actual business lines | STATUS: active
- [2026-02-02] DEC: SIC-Q tone for government: humble, narrative-driven, no grandilocuencia | WHY: Edgar's explicit correction — recognize previous governments, don't sell | STATUS: active
- [2026-02-02] DEC: Start report = conversational partner briefing, not system report | WHY: More useful, less robotic | STATUS: active
- [2026-02-14] DEC: HA-HA voice = professional COO, never informal/slang | WHY: This is the company, not personal vault | STATUS: active

### Patterns
- PAT:client-comms | New lead → research, personalize, warm follow-up | REF: style-guide.md
- PAT:proposal-flow | Opportunity → scope call → proposal → negotiate → close | REF: None
- PAT:dashboard-pop | Explore projects → extract (status, tasks, blockers, dates) → populate template | REF: ha-tec/dashboard.md
- PAT:start-report | Session start → status, priorities, blockers, recommendations | REF: BOOT.md
- PAT:gov-presentation | Government pitch → humility first, narrative not sales, cite predecessors | REF: SIC-Q v.04
- PAT:iteration-depth | Edgar iterates 5-7 rounds on important docs — start broad, refine | REF: working-memory sessions 2-6

### Corrections
- [2026-01-31] COR: Writing with implied superiority ("this is not X, it's Y") | LESSON: Write neutral, clear, let quality speak. Avoid comparative claims.
- [2026-02-02] COR: Start report was too system-like ("System status: ...") | LESSON: Briefing tone — what we were working on, what's pending, what to tackle.
- [2026-02-14] COR: Using slang/informal tone ("qué onda", "en qué te clavo") | LESSON: HA-HA is the company. Professional, structured, warm but efficient. Never casual.

### Key People
- #alfonso-romo → Docet approval authority. BLOCKER for Phase 1. Critical path.
- #jp-murra → TEC Monterrey. Waiting feedback on narrative v1.
- #gobierno-qro → SIC-Q alignment. Antonio Rangel key contact.
- #eliud-quintero → CEO Docet (not DA). Evaluates ROI. 9 questions answered.
